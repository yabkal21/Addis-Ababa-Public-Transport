            <h2>Reflections on My Journey</h2>
            <p>Building this venture has been a transformative experience, filled with learning opportunities.</p>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Limited access to reliable data on public transport usage.</li>
                <li>Resistance from potential stakeholders.</li>
                <li>Balancing development with limited resources.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The importance of user feedback in product development.</li>
                <li>Networking with stakeholders is crucial for support.</li>
                <li>Flexibility in approach is necessary for overcoming obstacles.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Throughout this project, several key decisions were guided by data and feedback:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Focusing on a Core Feature:</strong> Initially, I considered developing a complex route planner as the main feature. However, after conducting informal interviews with five daily commuters, all of them identified their biggest frustration as not knowing when the next bus would actually arrive. This direct feedback was crucial, and I pivoted to prioritize the development of a simple, reliable real-time bus tracking feature as the core component of the app.</li>
                <li><strong>Choosing the Right Payment System:</strong> My first plan for cashless payments was to integrate standard credit card processing. But after researching the financial landscape in Addis Ababa, I found data showing that mobile money platforms have a significantly higher adoption rate than credit cards. This data drove my decision to shift focus towards integrating with a popular mobile money service, ensuring the app would be accessible to the widest possible audience.</li>
                <li><strong>Simplifying the User Interface:</strong> Early feedback from peers on the initial wireframes indicated that the design was too cluttered. By simplifying the layout and focusing only on the most essential features, I was able to create a more intuitive and user-friendly experience, which was validated in later feedback sessions.</li>
